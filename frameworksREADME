Create project:
---------------

0. If re-starting a project, rename the old one to *O.xcodeproj to keep sources list and libraries needed
1. Start with with  Cross-platform Empty project: "COMMAND-SHIFT-N". Do no create local git repos.
2. Close it. Move the project from  its own dir created to one dir up. Delete dir.
3. Add all the files (make sure to do scons -c to avoid including objects). Added folders: Create groups (create folder reference won't let add sources later)


Add Sources and Libraries
-------------------------

 1. On the general project add "settings.xcconfig" configuration for debug and release

 2. Add macos Library target "libraryName". Static STLC++ to archive the executable. Organization Identifier: mlibrary
    a. remove libraryName directoy
    b. add source libraryName.cc in Compile Sources "Build Phases"

 3. Open Framework and library dir of interest

    Qt:     open $QTDIR/lib/
	 geant4: open $G4ROOT/$GEANT4_VERSION/lib/
	 ccdb:   open $CCDB_HOME/lib/
    clhep:  open $CLHEP_BASE_DIR/lib/

	Drag needed to "Build Phases" Link with Libraries

 4. Add macos command line tool exampleName, C++, Organization Identifier:  libraryName.
    a. remove exampleName dir
    b  drag source exampleName.cc in Compile Sources build phase
    c. add libraryName link Binary with Libraries on Build Phases
    d. copy manually do not do this: drag frameworks to Copy files, products location must match CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR
 	    - no subpath
	    - uncheck Copy only when installing
	    - executables

 5. Build Settings: Code Signing: do not code sign

 6. For archiving purposes, (not in build phases, do it manually) copy necessary items in "executables destination",
     - this includes the rcc file (in case it's needed, see qtButtonsWidget)
     - uncheck Copy only when installing
     To run the app by command line, add @executable_path to run path in Linking

7. To create rcc file for xcode:
   rcc -binary exampleResources.qrc -o exampleResources.rcc
   scons on the other hand knows about it because the qt module
   compiles exampleResources.qrc directly



Libraries Version Warning:
--------------------------

The various libraries and frameworks need to be in the same dir as the executable. They have to be the same version.
Best way: clean that directory and copy manually the various libraries and frameworks.
The location is specified in ceInstall/settings:

MYBUILDDIR = /Users/ungaro/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/builds


Q_OBJECT and xcode
------------------

Select your project target and in Build Rules make a new custom rule ("+" button).
Set the "Process" drop down to "Source files with names matching" and type in *.h next to that. 
Set the "Using" drop down to "Custom script:" and in the script type:

/path/to/your/Qt/bin/moc ${INPUT_FILE_PATH} -o ${DERIVED_FILE_DIR}/${INPUT_FILE_BASE}_moc.cpp
Yo will have to change the path to wherever your moc executable is.

Now add the "Output files" ("+" button):
${DERIVED_FILE_DIR}/${INPUT_FILE_BASE}_moc.cpp

Xcode will then run moc on the headers in Build Phases and it will understand
that the output from moc is a .cpp and needs to be compiled and linked into you app and do that for you.


REMAKE XCODE Projects
---------------------

The idea is to rename the current projects with an "O" at the end of the name, open it and create a new one.
The Old project will give directives on what to include.

See instructions above on creating empty project.

cd "/Users/ungaro/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/xcode/mlibrary/"

set listTodo = (`\ls | grep ".xcodeproj" | grep -v "O.xcodeproj"`)

foreach p ($listTodo)
	set toRename = `echo $p | awk -F. '{print $1}'`
	echo $toRename
	mv $p $toRename"O.xcodeproj"
end
